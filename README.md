- 👋 Hi, I’m @smosanu
- 👀 I’m interested in FPGA projects, computer architecture emulation, RISC-V, machine learning / artificial intelligence / generative AI, high performance computing, embedded and IoT systems and applications, and other cool concepts 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and experimenting with generative AI, and trying to contribute from the architecture side of things, plus I'm preparing for technical interviews and working on a paper related to my Ph.D. thesis
- 💞️ I’m looking for new opportunities, work on AI, computer architecture, FPGA and other related fields
- 📫 Reach me on twitter @smosanu or email me.
