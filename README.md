- 👋 Hi, I’m @smosanu
- 👀 I’m interested in FPGA projects, computer architecture emulation, RISC-V, machine learning, high performance computing, embedded and IoT systems and applications, and other cool concepts 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how memory flavors evolved, how to emulate and evaluate them with benchmarks in a miniaturized system using LiteX, how things work
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on memory and processing-in-memory emulation / prototyping on FPGAs and applications of interest
- 📫 Reach me on twitter @smosanu or email me.
